Problem Statement-

Categorize the countries using some socio-economic and health factors
that determine the overall development of the country, to finally suggest the countries which the CEO
needs to focus on the most. HELP International is an international humanitarian NGO that is
committed to fighting poverty and providing the people of backward countries with basic amenities
and relief during the time of disasters and natural calamities. HELP International has been able to
raise around $ 10 million. Now the CEO of the NGO needs to decide how to use this money
strategically and effectively.


Solution - 
The CEO has to make a decision to choose the countries that are in
the direst need of aid. In order to achieve this, we use multiple methods for clustering the data into
the categories such as ‘Help needed’, ‘Might need help’ and ‘No help needed’.
